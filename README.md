# Advent of Code 2018

This repository contains my personal solutions for the Advent of Code challenges for 2018. Nothing formal here, and I'll probably get busy or forget halfway through the advent.

Check out the challenges [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018) and see the solutions in directories indexed by day. I'm working in Elixir for practice and learning.
